hi
I already read through the project descriptions.

but for wonderful UI building and perfect design, I think it might be better if you send me the figma design in the way you want.

If it's tough job for you, please give me exact details.

for example:

please check the attached picture.

i just simply sketched for understanding your requirement.

is it the similar way you think?

especially in "Column layout displaying news articles" and "news feed" part.

there must be menu list part on the left side of the page and on the right page there should be the detail full part of a clicked news article.

and where do you want to set the column layout displaying new articles? or you want other routing page for it?

and in the news feed part, do you want the news feed displayed as in the "layout.png"?

for the more convenient proceeding. it might be the best way to send me the detailed figma designs and styles also you like, I think.

i'm waiting for your reply.
